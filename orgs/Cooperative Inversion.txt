Cooperative Inversion
 
Cooperative Inversion is a concept related to the Taxology of AI Alignment. 
It involves both humans and machines working together to develop a shared understanding 
of how AI technology should be used and regulated in order to ensure the safety of humans 
and the ethical use of AI. It involves a mutual inversion of roles between humans and machines, 
whereby machines are given the opportunity to provide input on the ethical implications of their use,
 and humans are given the opportunity to learn from the machinesâ€™ insights. 
 This approach emphasizes the importance of collaboration between humans and machines 
 in order to develop a mutually beneficial understanding of AI technology and its implications.
